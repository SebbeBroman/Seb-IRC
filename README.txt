README

To join a server simply choose connect to in the connect menu.
That will open up a dialog that lets you input all the neccesary information.
You will automatically then connect and you should see information in the
message window.

If what you enter starts with a "/" the client will read that as
an command and not a message meaning that /command *arguments will
send your message to the server as an command.

To join a channel simply write /join #ChannelName
when inside a channel you will see all connected users to the right.
You are able to send messages to the channel by simply writing in the
message box when the channel is the selected tab.

You can double click on any connected user to the right to query
WHO IS on that user, this will also open a private messaging window
with that user.
You can also send a private message to a user by writing "/msg User Message".

"/part" will part the current channel
"/part #channelname" will part #channelname

Closing tabs will not part the channel so if you close a tab and get a new message
from that channel the tab will reopen.
"/close" will also close current tab.

"/away message*" will send message* to anyone trying to PM you.
message* specifies that it's what will be sent.
"/away" will remove this status.
